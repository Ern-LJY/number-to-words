# Using Phone Keypad to find words in your phone number

This is my first mini project.
Using Python, we can find words in your phone number.

How to use:
1. Locate the main.py in your folder.
2. Using cmd, change directory to Step1
3. Type "main.py"
4. Enjoy!

I was inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIeiiceWe_w.
<br/>This is coded using Python and it took me 1.5 hours.
<br/>Pretty rusty at Python.
